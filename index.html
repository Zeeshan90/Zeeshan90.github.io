    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am an experienced <span class="highlight">iOS and Flutter developer</span>  with over 5 years of hands-on experience in building and maintaining high-quality mobile applications. Starting my career as an iOS developer in 2018 at WBM, I have successfully contributed to a wide range of projects. In July 2020, I joined Abacus and played a key role in developing Pakistan's top leasing application, UPAISA. My expertise extends to both iOS and Flutter development, and in November 2022, I transitioned to a role where I continued to work on iOS and Flutter applications, developing solutions such as property apps, Uber-like apps, parking spot booking systems, and a Canada tax filing submission app. One of my notable Flutter projects was SSOBox, an app designed to fetch call and SMS logs and securely move them to a server for better communication insights.
